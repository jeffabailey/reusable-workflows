# Graph Renderer

A simple HTMX + Cytoscape.js interface for visualizing the graph generated by the `generate-graph` workflow.

## Features

- Loads and renders the graph from `../generate-graph/graph.json`
- Interactive graph visualization with Cytoscape.js
- Multiple layout options (Dagre, Breadthfirst, CoSE, Grid, Circle)
- Node and edge interaction (click to see details)
- Color-coded nodes by depth
- Zoom and pan controls

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Load Graph" to load and visualize the graph
3. Use the layout dropdown to change the graph layout
4. Click on nodes or edges to see their details in the status bar
5. Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- The `graph.json` file must exist in `../generate-graph/graph.json`
- Internet connection (for loading HTMX and Cytoscape.js from CDN)

## Serving Locally

If you encounter CORS issues when opening the file directly, serve it using a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/.github/workflows/render-graph/index.html` in your browser.
